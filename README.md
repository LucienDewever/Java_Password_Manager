# Java_Password_Manager
A basic graphical password generator and manager written in Java using the Swing library

## Capabilites 
Can generate passwords between 8 and 24 Characters

Toggles for Special Character, Ambiguous Characters, Numbers, Uppercase and Lowercase Letters

Can Specify any characters you do not want to appear in your password

Can save Passwords to a .txt file

# issues
The file choosing system is abysmally bad. Choosing the file is somewhat unintuitive and saves files as a generic file type unless ".txt" is typed in to the file name area

There is no security on the file that passwords are saved to which partly invalidates the point of a password manager, however this is a basic project and not in any way meant to be a real product

Pop-ups for invalid actions can be brought up infinitely as they do not close when the button that brought them up is pushed again

# Functional Improvements
I think it would be cool to add the option to include the site the password is for in the file next to the password itself
